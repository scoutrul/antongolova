The UAE legal market is huge, but mercilessly chaotic: dozens of niches, hundreds of firms, thousands of freelance lawyers, and everyone has their own rules of the game.\nWe are facing several challenges:\n\n- it is difficult for people to find a lawyer: There is no transparency, no prices, no understanding of who to trust\n- lawyers spend a lot of time on cold applications, routine and haphazard negotiations\n- the format of the \"lawyers directory\" is no longer working — the market is oversaturated\n- there was not a single convenient platform based on the principle of \"explain the problem → get solutions\" in the region.\n\nWe understood that if we just made \"another marketplace\", the product would sink. We needed a niche that we would definitely get into — and a UX that could hold even an inexperienced user.",

Each with their own logic, scripts, subscriptions, and features\n- a system of components for marketing: so that the team can launch dozens of campaigns and test hypotheses on real lawyers and clients."

And lawyers don't need to communicate with hundreds of random clients — they need to receive warm, understandable tasks. Hence the idea of a \"closed auction\" was born: the client writes a problem → lawyers give their options → the client chooses the best offer."
