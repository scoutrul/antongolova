In fact, these are virtual servers that can be rented, configured, and used as infrastructure for products, websites, and projects. But when I joined the team as chief designer, the service lived a double life: formally, it was already a product, but in fact it still remained an internal tool of AdGuard."

In this case, I will tell you how we transformed the product, simplified the complex technical experience, made the interfaces understandable even for beginners, and increased revenue."

Any little thing takes several weeks of development. The interfaces looked like the user needed to first complete an internship at DevOps in order to understand something.\n\nBut the most unpleasant thing happened next.\n\nSome critical things came up during the research:\n\n- server installation is a complex multi—step process where users just got lost\n- the funnel burst in several places, people did not reach the payment\n- server management scenarios were confusing and intimidating to newbies\n- edge cases broke the UX and pushed customers to support\n- the competition in the segment is high, and the product itself did not distinguish itself in any way\n- trust in the service was low — it looked crude and \"technical for techies.\"\n\nWe saw that if we want to turn Serveroid into a commercial product, rather than an internal tool, we need to change everything.",
